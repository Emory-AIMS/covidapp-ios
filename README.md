# About CovidApp

CovidApp - Covid Community Alert is an open-source contact tracing app that uses Bluetooth LE to anonimously track interactions between devices.  

This app goes in pair with [CoviDoc](https://gitlab.com/coronavirus-outbreak-control/coronavirus-outbreak-control-ios-doctors),
the app that doctors can use to identify infected patients.   

### Privacy
Our aim is to protect and maintain the privacy of our users - we **do not take any personal information, or store continuos real-time GPS location**
of the users;  

If the user gives consent of sharing the location (which is **optional**), we do not actively keep track of it:
we only add the location to the interactions, so if interactions are not occuring no data is being logged at all.
When a location is recorded it is *intentionally* with a low precision (100-120 meters); this is to make it impossible to know the exact location of a user,
but still allow insight into which areas could see an increase in cases.
